# Texas Venture Capital Group Website

## Organization

This project has been organized into several parts. Please keep all appropriate materials in their respective locations.

### Components

This is where all page components go. Each component should be functional on its own.

### Images

All image resources should be placed here. Acceptable are PNG, SVG, JPEG/JPG, etc. No code should be placed here except for the index.js file.

### Pages

Only fully functional pages directly used by App.jsx should be placed here. Should use as many components from the "components" folder as possible, with as few components directly written onto these files as possible.

## Standards

There are several standards for building code in this present project. Please follow these conventions

- Margins always are only on the right and bottom of a component
- Use flexbox when possible
- All styling will be in-line using styled-components, not CSS. Please look online for resources on this styling standard
- All components should be functional. No object components
- Use hooks for managing state, reducers, etc.
- Will be updated with more to come!

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run deploy`

Use this to deploy the website onto github. Make sure to have your remote repo origin set to the texas-vcg repo.
